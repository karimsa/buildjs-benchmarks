# JS Build Tools Benchmarks [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karimsa/buildjs-benchmarks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karimsa/buildjs-benchmarks)

This repository is meant to display the automated benchmarks
of the various build tools available to JS users. The only major
requirements for the build tool is for it to be truly configurable
and extensible enough to run customized build processes.

The classification of 'webpack' as a build tool is controversial
as it is more built to be a robust dependecy management tool and
acts as a build tool by accident.

## Support tools

 - gulp
 - grunt
 - fly
 - brunch
 - broccoli
 - hopp

*Please open an issue to discuss additions to this list.*

## Contributing

This may not be the greatest attempt to benchmark these tools as
it does not extensively calculate any tool's capabilities. Possible
thoughts for future updates is to add a few standard plugins to each
and to calculate with and without each plugin to be able to provide
more detailed benchmarks (i.e. eslint, babel, etc.).

If you would like to help out with the project or believe that things
should be done differently, please open [an issue](issues).

Enjoy! :)
